# N-Queens Problem Solution (N=8)

## Overview
This program solves the classic N-Queens problem for N=8 using a backtracking algorithm. The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

## Algorithm
- **Approach**: Backtracking with constraint satisfaction
- **Strategy**: Place queens row by row, checking for conflicts at each step
- **Optimization**: Early pruning when conflicts are detected

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^N) in the worst case cause we check for every column in every row
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for the board array and recursion stack
- **For N=8**: Approximately 40,320 operations in worst case

## How to Run
```bash
gcc -o nqueens main.c -Wall -Wextra
./nqueens
```

## Output
- Displays all 92 possible solutions for the 8-Queens problem
- Each solution shows both compact format and visual board representation
- Includes statistics and fun facts about the problem


## Sample Output
