DarthRevan02: @agent Enable: "Enable Claude Sonnet 4 for all clients"

GitHub Copilot: I'll write an optimal power function in C using the exponentiation by squaring algorithm, which has O(log n) time complexity instead of O(n). Let me implement this in your `ques1.c` file. 
```


Made changes.


```
I've implemented an optimal power function in C with the following features:

## Key Optimizations:

1. **Exponentiation by Squaring**: The main algorithm reduces time complexity from O(n) to O(log n) by:
   - If the exponent is even: `base^n = (base^(n/2))^2`
   - If the exponent is odd: `base^n = base * (base^(n/2))^2`

2. **Iterative Approach**: The primary `power()` function uses iteration instead of recursion to avoid stack overflow for large exponents and uses O(1) space.

## How the Algorithm Works:

- **Binary Representation**: The algorithm essentially uses the binary representation of the exponent
- **Squaring**: In each iteration, we square the base and halve the exponent
- **Odd Handling**: When the exponent is odd, we multiply the current result by the base
- **Negative Base Handling**: Properly handles negative bases by tracking the sign

## Example Walkthrough:
For `2^10`:
- Start: base=2, exp=10, result=1
- Iteration 1: exp=10 (even), base=4, exp=5, result=1
- Iteration 2: exp=5 (odd), result=4, base=16, exp=2
- Iteration 3: exp=2 (even), base=256, exp=1, result=4
- Iteration 4: exp=1 (odd), result=1024, base=65536, exp=0
- Final result: 1024

The code also includes:
- A recursive implementation for comparison
- Comprehensive test cases
- Interactive input handling
- Proper edge case handling (negative bases, zero exponent)

You can compile and run this code to test the power function with various inputs!

DarthRevan02: it should also work for integers raised to the power of float, floats raised to the power of integers, and floats raised to the power of floats

GitHub Copilot: I'll modify the power function to handle floating-point bases and exponents. This requires a different approach since exponentiation by squaring only works for integer exponents. For floating-point exponents, we'll need to use logarithms.

I need to fix these compilation errors by including the necessary headers and avoiding the variable name conflict with the `exp` function from math.h. 
```

DarthRevan02: @agent Try Again

GitHub Copilot: I need to fix the variable name conflict with the `exp` function. Let me rename the parameter. 
```


Made changes.


```


DarthRevan02: @agent Try Again

GitHub Copilot: The variable name conflict with the exp() function is now resolved. The power functions now support all combinations: integer base/integer exponent, integer base/float exponent, float base/integer exponent, and float base/float exponent.

You can now use these functions for any type of power calculation in C. Let me know if you want a main function or test cases to demonstrate usage!

- Analyze space complexity and identify memory bottlenecks
- Determine the crossover point where adjacency list becomes better than adjacency matrix
- Explain why Kruskal's uses O(E log E) time while Prim's can achieve O(E + V log V)"

## **Advanced Implementation Questions:**

### 9. **Memory Management Question**
"Analyze the memory management in this code:

These questions test understanding of algorithms, data structures, optimization techniques, practical applications, and implementation details at various levels of complexity.
