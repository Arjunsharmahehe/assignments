Welcome to the assignment repository! This guide will help you understand the structure and naming conventions used in this repo so you can easily find and manage your work.

## Folder Structure

- **Each assignment date has its own folder**
	- Example: `13Aug2025/`, `14Aug2025/`
- **Inside each date folder:**
	- Each question is in its own subfolder (e.g., `ques1/`, `ques2/`, etc.)
	- Each question folder contains:
		- `main.c` (the code for the question)
		- `README.md` (details or notes for the question)

## Naming Conventions

- **A**: Stands for "Assignment question". These are the main questions to be completed for the assignment.
- **SP**: Stands for "Side Piece". These are not urgent, but PC (Pravin Chandra) might ask for them randomly. Complete them if you have extra time.

## Tips for Navigation

- To find assignments for a specific date, open the corresponding date folder.
- To find a specific question, look for its subfolder (e.g., `ques1/`).
- Check the `README.md` in each question folder for details or instructions.

## Example Structure

```
assignments/
	13Aug2025/
		ques1/
			main.c
			README.md
		ques2/
			main.c
			README.md
		...
	14Aug2025/
		...
```
