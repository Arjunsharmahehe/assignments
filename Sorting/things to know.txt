-lm

This tells the linker to link with the math library (libm).

Required when you use math functions like:

sqrt()

log()

pow()

sin(), cos(), etc.

Without -lm, you’ll get "undefined reference" errors for those functions.

✅ 3. -O2

This enables compiler optimizations at level 2.

-O2 is a moderate optimization level:

Makes the code faster and smaller than default (-O0)

Without being as aggressive as -O3 (which may increase binary size or compile time)

✅ It’s commonly used for production builds where speed matters but you still want decent compile times.
